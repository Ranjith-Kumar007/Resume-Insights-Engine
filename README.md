**TOPIC: Comparative analysis on OpenAI Data Extraction in Resume document using OpenAI Keys vs Local LLM Implementation without Internet connectivity.**

INTRODUCTION: 
In the rapidly advancing landscape of technology, generative AI has assumed a central role. Possibilities such as text and image generation have become commonplace. However, the question arises: can we effectively extract specific text from a document using this technology? utilizing OpenAI Keys for remote extraction and implementing Local LLM (Large Language Model) for extraction without internet connectivity. Focusing on critical information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers, this investigation aims to evaluate the performance, reliability, and feasibility of these methodologies in the context of a resume document. 

Go through the document uploaded in the Repository to understand the Methodology, Challenges, Usage guides and the future works that can implemented.
